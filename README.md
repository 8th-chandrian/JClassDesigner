#JClassDeisgner
This is the final project which I built for my CSE 219 class. It is currently incomplete, but still has the vast majority of its functionality. It acts as a UML Diagram editing program, and gives users the option to export the diagram which they created to compilable Java skeleton code.

The functionality which is currently complete is:

- Adding classes/interfaces
- Editing and moving classes/interfaces
- Adding parents/variables/methods to classes
- Taking snapshots of designs (snapshots exported as .png files)
- Saving/loading designs
- Exporting to code (almost entirely functional)
- Grid display and snap-to-grid

The functions still in process are:

- Undo/Redo
- Zoom in/Zoom out
- A few aspects of exporting to code

Installation Note: To fix broken dependencies after cloning, requisite .jar files have been included in resources folder

A note on the code in general: It's a bit of a mess currently. Much of it was written very quickly and as such is not particularly reader-friendly. I do intend to clean it up when I get the time, however.
