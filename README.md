This is the final project which I built for my CSE 219 class. It is currently incomplete, but still has basic functionality. It acts as a UML Diagram editing program, and gives users the option to export the diagram which they created to compilable Java skeleton code.

The functions still in progress are: Undo/Redo, Zoom In/Zoom Out, and some limited export-to-code functionality.
